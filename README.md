Masters thesis - Echinoderm ossicles
This is the github repository for my masters thesis   
This will host the data and r scripts as well as word/google docs produced in the writing of my thesis in academic year 2  
Data is curretntly stored on an External SSD  and will be migrated into the repository  

Whilst I will look to write in R Markdown, the majority of word processing will likely take plae in Microsoft Word to allow for supervisor comments and then be periodically synced to a folder in the repo
